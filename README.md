# Beer Catalog

## Project Description
Beer Catalog is a React application built using Vite that allows users to browse a collection of beers fetched from the [Sample APIs](https://api.sampleapis.com/beers/ale). The application displays beer details in a card-based layout and includes a search functionality to filter beers by their name.

## Features
- **Beer Cards**: Each beer is displayed in a card with its image, name, and price.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for beers by name in real time.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
- **Fast Development**: Built using Vite for faster build and development times.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: As the development and build tool.
- **Axios**: For fetching data from the API.
- **CSS**: For styling components.
